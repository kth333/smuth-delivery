# Smuth Delivery

A Telegram-based student-run delivery and pickup service at SMU. It allows students to order food and drinks easily, while other students can fulfill these orders for a small fee ($1â€“$2). 

Smuth Delivery was designed to solve common struggles among students such as feeling hungry in class, dealing with cravings, or not having enough time between lessons to get food.

### How It Works
1. **Place an order** through [Smuth Bot](https://t.me/Smuth_Bot) with details like restaurant, items, and drop-off location and time.
2. **Order is broadcasted** in [Smuth Delivery](https://t.me/smuth_delivery), where runners can accept it.
3. **Runner picks up and delivers** the order, with payment handled directly between the requester and runner.
4. **Communicate with the orderer/runner** through their Telegram handle sent to you by the bot.
5. **Subscribe to the channel** for real-time updates on new orders and claimed orders.
